# [LogicGep: Boolean networks inference using symbolic regression from time-series transcriptomic profiling data](https://github.com/DZ-Z/LogicGep)

![Screenshot](Figure/MCTS1-2.png)

In this work, we proposed a new method for BN inference from time-series transcriptional profiles, called LogicGep,
which reconstructs the network topology and identifies each geneâ€™s Boolean update function with a low time
complexity

## Dependencies
requirements.txt
  
## Usage

1. Preparing  for  time-series gene expression profiles
   
   For the input data, ensure that it is structured with rows representing different time points and columns 
   corresponding to various genes
   
3. Command to run LogicGep
 
   ``cd LogicGep ``  
   ``python main.py``
